           Your Own Voice is an initiative from the
          teacher José Adrián Fonollosa of the subject “Projecte Avançat
          d’Enginyeria” at Universitat Politècnica de Catalunya and carried out
          by students coursing it. This project works respecting the General
          Data Protection Regulation (EU 2016/679). The responsibility of the
          treatment of the data is the Your Own Voice team. The goal of this
          treatment is to obtain synthetic voices in order to use them, for
          example, by people with speech issues. The personal data requested is
          only the email. Cessions: No data will be transferred except as
          provided by law. The rights over your data are those of access,
          deletion, rectification, opposition, limitation of processing,
          portability and oblivion. You can exercise them by sending your
          request to the team leader, at this email address
          sara.tarrats@estudiantat.upc.edu . As a company we assure not to make
          any use of this data without the explicit consent of the user. We do
          not allow minors to upload personal data, as it is explicitly
          indicated on the web. Before publishing a voice we will check that it
          is not a child's voice. An ethical important value we have as a
          company is that we take care of having both men and women in the
          models. We commit ourselves to offer a representative service for all
          the population.

          Even if it is true that the energy
          consumption caused by our computers and the server is not despicable,
          we are proud because it is not too high and has acceptable values. We
          believe that the amount of good we make for society compensates this
          negative aspect about energy consumption. In fact, we are happy to
          announce that our estimate is that in 2024 this consumption will be
          reduced by 50%.
